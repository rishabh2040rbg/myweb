<h1>Porche 718 Cayman GT4 RS  </h1>


The Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS is a two-door, two-seater sports car with a 3.996 cc, 6-cylinder flat engine. It has a top speed of 315 km/h and can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.4 seconds. 
The Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS is a high-performance, track-focused variant of the 718 Cayman, considered the pinnacle of the lineup, featuring aggressive aerodynamic elements, a lightweight design with extensive carbon fiber components, and a potent engine, making it a thrilling driving experience particularly on winding roads and race circuits; key features include a central locking system with "RS" branding, forged magnesium wheels for weight reduction, and adjustable suspension for fine-tuning handling on different tracks. porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS is the top model in the 718 lineup and the price of 718 top model is Rs. 2.74 Crore. Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS is available in Automatic (DCT) transmission and offered in 4 colours: Black, Guards Red, White and Racing Yellow.Drived from the 911 GT3 R and 911 RSR directly: 368 kW
(500 PS) at 8,400 1/min, max. torque 450 Nm at 6,750 1/min. The centrally positioned 4.0-litre six-cylinder high-revving naturally aspirated boxer engine is by far the most powerful in the 718 model range.6 individual throttle valves supply the 6 cylinders with air for direct responsiveness and excellent dosing of the engine. It is powerful and robust thanks to a central oil feed, forged pistons and lightweight titanium con rods.The shifts of the performance-orientated 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) are fast and emotive. Even the 7th gear has a short, sporty response. The mechanical locking differential ensures optimal power transmission.The PTV improves the driving dynamics. The integrated mechanical rear differential lock enables higher traction and significantly improved lateral dynamics and driving stability during load changes in bends and when changing lanes.Lightweight suspension strut axles, taut springs and helper springs in combination with specific wheel mounts ensure high traction and stability. Ball joints allow particularly precise wheel guidance.The ride height, camber, toe and anti-roll bar can be adjusted for use on the race track. The result is a race track chassis for high cornering dynamics, spontaneous steering behaviour and higher cornering speeds.The electronic adjus hent of the damping control system actively and continuously adjusts the damping force on each wheel, based on current road conditions and driving style. The PASM has two settings: sporty-comfortable and sporty-firm.For fast and safe braking to a standstill: six-piston front and four-piston rear aluminium monobloc fixed calliper brakes with Red brake callipers and large Grey cast aluminium composite brake discs. The efficient brake ventilation and cooling system is specially designed for high loads.

<h1> Porche 911 Carrera GTS </h1>

<p> 911 Carrera GTS models are equipped, as standard, with PASM Sport Suspension (-10 mm) with helper springs at the rear and rear-axle steering, which not only increases performance on track but agility on the road.In the mid-1970s, the naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSR won world championship races including Targa Florio and the 24 Hours of Daytona. The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. Porsche won the World Championship for Makes in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 with 911-derived models.Crucial to the high performance of the T-Hybrid system: the innovative main components. From the completely redeveloped 3.6-litre flat engine with electric exhaust turbocharger to the electric motor integrated in the PDK and the light, powerful traction battery.This is what only a 911 sounds like: the new flat engine in the rear impresses with a classic 6-cylinder symphony, an increase in displacement from 3.0 to 3.6 l and further increased power output.aust
The electric exhaust turbocharger ensures a faster increase in the performance-determining boost pressure and thus accelerated response behaviour. In Recuperation mode, energy from the exhaust stream is converted into electrical energy
- similar to the Porsche 919 Hybrid developed for racing.System power: 398 kW (541 PS). Top speed: 312 km/h.
With this technical data, a torque combined of 610 Nm and a sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.0 s, it's highly unlikely that you will ever want to get out again.Clear lines and a muscular rear section create a much sharper character. On the GTS models, the newly designed front apron with striking vertical aerodynamic elements including adaptive air intake flaps provide a further distinctive visual feature.Expressive and typically Porsche: the new Matrix LED main headlights, including all lighting functions such as the 4-point daytime running lights, increase the dis-tinctive look of the 911 from afar with their lighting signature.The instrument cluster with 12.65-inch curved display puts the focus on the central rev counter with the classic five-tube view or the reduced Sport Chrono screen' as desired.
'Optionally available for 911 Carrera.The further integration of Apple® CarPlay® enables improved Siri funcionality and control of vehicle functions, to name just a couple.

<h1> Porche 911 GT3 </h1>

<p> The new 911 GT3 RS is set perfomance orientated – thanks to increased downforce and revised aerodynamics. Using all vehicle data, including longitudinal/lateral acceleration, accelerator/brake pedal position and friction values, even the position of the rear wing and front diffuser are automatically adjusted to the driving situation in split seconds by Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA) with DRS. Best prerequisites for the next flying lap.The new aerobars on the front axle increase downforce by reducing turbulence and the flow rate behind the bars – by up to 40 kg at top speed. Sophisticated technology, derived from motorsports.S-Duct front with single-cooler concept.
Like the GT racing cars, the new 911 GT3 RS has a single, large centre radiator in place of the front luggage compartment. The S-shaped air guide gives the concept its name. The concept ensures improved aerodynamics in terms of downforce and brake cooling compared to the two side coolers and the small centre cooler that are otherwise used.The wide turbo body with air intake panel significantly contributes to the aerodynamic optimisation of the 911 GT3 RS and reinforces the athletic appearance. It also opens up space for new, wider wheels that improve handling even further.Headwind is one of the biggest challenges on the way to fast lap times. The new 911 GT3 RS uses air flow optimally with every component. The setup for the best possible drag coefficient is completed by a two-piece rear section with enlarged air vents, rear spoiler with rear ventilation and a diffuser.The highest maxim in lightweight construction: reduce to the maximum. The new 911 GT3 RS also remains true to this motorsport philosophy – despite the significantly expanded and further improved equipment compared to its predecessors, including the active aerodynamics, wider wheels and tyres, wider body and more extensive adjustment options for the chassis in different driving modes.The consistent use of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) enables an unladen weight of just 1,450 kg. The wings, front lid in a specific RS shape and roof are all made of motorsport-tested materials. The CFRP rear wing with active aerodynamics, CFRP doors for optimised wheel arch vents, and aluminium and magnesium lightweight forged wheels also yield significant advantages on the race track.In a battle for thousandths, every gram counts. The optional Weissach package reduces the weight by just under 15 kg. The front lid, roof and top half of the exterior mirror in carbon-weave finish (high-gloss) also visually heighten the motor sport character of the new 911 GT3 RS – just like the rear wing, which is partly made in a carbon-weave finish (high-gloss), and large 'PORSCHE' lettering.The lightweight full bucket seats made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) in a carbon-weave finish (satin) already offer a high level of lateral support as standard. They also feature impressive seat covers in Black leather, seat centres with continuous perforation in Black Race-Tex with Red or Silver contrasting colour.

<h1>Porche Panamera GTS</h1>

<p> Porsche Panamera GTS is the top model in the Porsche Panamera lineup and the price of Panamera top model is Rs. 2.34 Crore. Porsche Panamera GTS is available in Automatic (DCT) transmission and offered in 11 colours: Lugano Blue , Gentian Blue, Black, Jet Black Metallic, Volcano Grey Metallic, Provence, Madeira Gold Metallic, Ice Grey Metallic, Dolomite Silver Metallic, Carrara White Metallic and White.n addition to its power output /368 kW (500 PS) and maximum torque of 660 Nm, another special feature that underlines the sports car character of the Panamera GTS is the naturally aspirated power delivery of the newly developed 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine.The sports suspension, specially tuned for the Panamera GTS, enables particularly high driving dynamics. The adaptive air suspension features fully load-bearing air spring struts in 2-chamber
2-valve technology, lowering of 10 mm and the electronically controlled Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) damper system. The rear axle stabiliser and the tuning of the chassis control systems are also GTS-specific.Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) is a variable torque distribution system on the rear wheels including an electronically controlled rear differential lock. The overall result: high lateral dynamic vehicle stability. Excellent traction. Great agility at every speed - with precise steering response and balanced load alteration behaviour. For even more pleasure on corners.The package with the eponymous stopwatch on the dashboard offers an even sportier tuning of the engine, gearbox and chassis.
The mode switch on the steering wheel can be used to choose between driving modes. The Sport Response button primes the engine and gearbox for the fastest possible unleashing of power
- for example, for overtaking. Launch Control helps achieve the best possible acceleration from a standstill.With the exception of the rear-drive Panamera, all models are equipped with Porsche Traction Management (PTM): active all-wheel drive system with an electronically variable, map-con-trolled multi-plate clutch, automatic brake differential (ABD) and anti-slip regulation (ASR).
